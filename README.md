# Magic Win EA

Magic Win EA is a forex trading expert advisor developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It implements the mean reversion concept and other algorithms to identify trading opportunities in the forex market. This ReadMe file provides an overview of the code and how it works.

## Custom Indicator: Mean Reversion Indicator

The code includes the implementation of a custom indicator called the Mean Reversion Indicator. This indicator helps in identifying potential reversals in the market based on mean reversion concepts and other algorithms.

## Currency Pair Selection

The EA is designed to enable trading on specific currency pairs. The selected currency pairs are:

- EURUSD
- GBPUSD
- AUDCAD
- AUDNZD
- NZDCAD

## Timeframe Selection

The trading timeframe is set to M15 (15 minutes). This means that the EA will analyze the market and execute trades based on the data available on the M15 timeframe.

## Expert Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is the expert initialization function. It performs various checks and setups before starting the trading operations.

- Dragging the EA onto a single chart: The EA should be attached to a chart. If it is not attached to any chart, an error message will be printed, and the initialization will fail.
- Simultaneous Trading: The EA allows trading on multiple currencies. It checks if the current symbol matches any of the specified currency pairs. If a match is found, a success message is printed. If no match is found, an error message is printed, and the initialization fails.
- Risk Modes: The EA provides four risk modes that users can choose from. The selected risk mode is printed as a message. If an invalid risk mode is selected, an error message is printed, and the initialization fails.
- Filters: The EA implements multiple filters for a tailored trading experience. Two example filters, `filter1` and `filter2`, are defined. If any of these filters fail, an error message is printed, and the initialization fails.

## Expert Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is the expert deinitialization function. It is called when the EA is being removed from the chart or when the terminal is closed. This function can be used to perform necessary cleanup tasks.

## Expert Tick Function

The `OnTick()` function is the expert tick function. It is called on every tick of the selected currency pairs. In this function, trading operations are performed based on the custom indicator and other algorithms.

## Expert Start Function

The `OnStart()` function is the expert start function. It is called when the EA is started or enabled for trading. In this function, trading is initiated based on the setup and user-defined preferences.
